              "description": "For centuries, an ancient technique of dyeing clothes called ikat has been practiced in Gualaceo. This technique consists of tying small strands of cabuya, a fiber of vegetable origin that comes from the fique plant (known locally as penco), in threads to draw patterns for what will later be a shawl. The more knots tied, the more complex and elaborate the process, which then, passes to the step of hand dying with leaves and fruits like walnut, to finally being woven by hand on a warp and becoming the famous shawl of Gualaceo. These shawls are of particular importance for being part of the traditional dress of the “Chola Cuencana”. There are shawls that take months to manufacture due to the complex process of elaboration. Learning from the hand of the artisans their techniques and processes is one of the most beautiful memories you can have in your visit to Cuenca.",

Chordeleg, is recognized for being home to some of the best jewelers in the country. In this place, silver melts at thousands of degrees to form tiny braided threads that later give shape to chains, earrings, tiaras and crowns. The technique of these artisans is known as filigree and the jewelers of this small town have practiced it for generations. The impressive ability to weave small threads together into a jewel makes this an activity worthy of being admired, and the pieces produced here qualify as small pieces of art.",
