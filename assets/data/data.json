The more knots tied, the more complex and elaborate the process, which then, passes to the step of hand dying with leaves and fruits like walnut, to finally being woven by hand on a warp and becoming the famous shawl of Gualaceo. These shawls are of particular importance for being part of the traditional dress of the “Chola Cuencana”. There are shawls that take months to manufacture due to the complex process of elaboration. Learning from the hand of the artisans their techniques and processes is one of the most beautiful memories you can have in your visit to Cuenca.",

The more knots tied, the more complex and elaborate the process, which then, passes to the step of hand dying with leaves and fruits like walnut, to finally being woven by hand on a warp and becoming the famous shawl of Gualaceo. These shawls are of particular importance for being part of the traditional dress of the “Chola Cuencana”. There are shawls that take months to manufacture due to the complex process of elaboration.
